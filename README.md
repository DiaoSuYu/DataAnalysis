# Consider the readability of the code, i break the code into two forms.
# The first code form is full automatic, it can complete all actions with one step.
# The first code form is 'Auto.py'.
# The Second code form is semi automatic, it can complete the corresponding actions.
# The Second code form consists of there parts, named: 'DataCrawl.py', 'DataClean.py' and 'ChartGenerate.py'.
